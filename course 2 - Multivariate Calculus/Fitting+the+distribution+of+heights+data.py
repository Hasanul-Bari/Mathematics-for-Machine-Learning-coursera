# # Fitting the distribution of heights data
# ## Instructions
# 
# In this assessment you will write code to perform a steepest descent to fit a Gaussian model to the distribution of heights data that was first introduced in *Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra*.
# 
# The algorithm is the same as you encountered in *Gradient descent in a sandpit* but this time instead of descending a pre-defined function, we shall descend the $\chi^2$ (chi squared) function which is both a function of the parameters that we are to optimise, but also the data that the model is to fit to.

# ## Background
# If we have data for the heights of people in a population, it can be plotted as a histogram, i.e., a bar chart where each bar has a width representing a range of heights, and an area which is the probability of finding a person with a height in that range.
# We can look to model that data with a function, such as a Gaussian, which we can specify with two parameters, rather than holding all the data in the histogram.
# 
# The Gaussian function is given as,
# $$f(\mathbf{x};\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(\mathbf{x} - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$
# 
# The figure above shows the data in orange, the model in magenta, and where they overlap in green.
# This particular model has not been fit well - there is not a strong overlap.
# 
# Recall from the videos the definition of $\chi^2$ as the squared difference of the data and the model, i.e $\chi^2 = |\mathbf{y} - f(\mathbf{x};\mu, \sigma)|^2$. This is represented in the figure as the sum of the squares of the pink and orange bars.
# 
# Don't forget that $\mathbf{x}$ an $\mathbf{y}$ are represented as vectors here, as these are lists of all of the data points, the |*abs-squared*|${}^2$ encodes squaring and summing of the residuals on each bar.
# 
# To improve the fit, we will want to alter the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$, and ask how that changes the $\chi^2$.
# That is, we will need to calculate the Jacobian,
# $$ \mathbf{J} = \left[ \frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \mu} , \frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \sigma} \right]\;. $$
# 
# Let's look at the first term, $\frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \mu}$, using the multi-variate chain rule, this can be written as,
# $$ \frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \mu} = -2 (\mathbf{y} - f(\mathbf{x};\mu, \sigma)) \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}(\mathbf{x};\mu, \sigma)$$
# With a similar expression for $\frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \sigma}$; try and work out this expression for yourself.
# 
# The Jacobians rely on the derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \sigma}$.
# Write functions below for these.

# GRADED FUNCTION

# This is the Gaussian function.
def f (x,mu,sig) :
    return np.exp(-(x-mu)**2/(2*sig**2)) / np.sqrt(2*np.pi) / sig

# Next up, the derivative with respect to μ.
# If you wish, you may want to express this as f(x, mu, sig) multiplied by chain rule terms.

# Next recall that steepest descent shall move around in parameter space proportional to the negative of the Jacobian,
# i.e., $\begin{bmatrix} \delta\mu \\ \delta\sigma \end{bmatrix} \propto -\mathbf{J} $, with the constant of proportionality being the *aggression* of the algorithm.
# 
# Modify the function below to include the $\frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \sigma}$ term of the Jacobian, the $\frac{\partial ( \chi^2 ) }{\partial \mu}$ term has been included for you.

# ## Test your code before submission
# To test the code you've written above, run all previous cells (select each cell, then press the play button [ ▶| ] or press shift-enter).
# You can then use the code below to test out your function.
# You don't need to submit these cells; you can edit and run them as much as you like.

# In[5]:


# First get the heights data, ranges and frequencies
x,y = heights_data()

# Next we'll assign trial values for these.
mu = 155 ; sig = 6
# We'll keep a track of these so we can plot their evolution.
p = np.array([[mu, sig]])

# Plot the histogram for our parameter guess
histogram(f, [mu, sig])
# Do a few rounds of steepest descent.
for i in range(50) :
    dmu, dsig = steepest_step(x, y, mu, sig, 2000)
    mu += dmu

    p = np.append(p, [[mu,sig]], axis=0)
# Plot the path through parameter space.

# Plot the final histogram.
histogram(f, [mu, sig])


# Note that the path taken through parameter space is not necesarily the most direct path, as with steepest descent we always move perpendicular to the contours.
