# # The Sandpit
# ## Jacobian
# The supervisor of a building site has dropped their mobile phone into a pit with an uneven floor, and it has rolled to the lowest point.
# To make matters worse, the pit has subsequently been filled with sand such that the phone is covered and cannot be seen.
# To find where in the pit their phone is, the supervisor has crafted a *‘dip-stick’* with a head designed to measure the slope of the floor if it is poked straight down through the sand.
# 
# By clicking on any point in the sandpit, and thereby measuring the negative of the Jacobian,
# $-\mathbf{J} = -\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$,
# at that point, try and find the supervisor's phone.
# Try to do this with as few dips as possible - the supervisor has calls to make!

# ## Depth Only
# Before trying the dip-stick that measures the Jacobian, the supervisor had contructed a dip-stick that can only measure the depth on each dip.
# 
# Without information about the Jacobian, try and find the supervisor's phone.
# This should certainly be more difficult!

# ## More Sandpits
# In a nearby building site, another phone has been dropped into a pit.
# Use the gradient dip-stick and help out the supervisor.

# You can run this example as many times as you like for a randomly generated sandpit.
